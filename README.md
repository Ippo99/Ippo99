  ### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
  
  I am a passionate IT Engineer in love with everything related to Cybersecurity. I have technical skills in Web exploitation and binary reversing as well as excellent interpersonal skills, enabling me to interact with a wide range of people. I really like to play CTFs, sports and share my passion with others. I'm currently looking for an internship in Cybersec. related fields.
